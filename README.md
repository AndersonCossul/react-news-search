## Basic React News Search

## Considerations
This is a project to practise React.<br>
I'm using Heroku to host this app. As I'm using the free account, the server shuts down after 30 minutes of inactivity, so after that it needs to restart and take a little time to boot up. After that, the performance is about the app, but before it, it's slow because of the server.

## Technologies
- Used the amazing React.
- Redux.
- Jest/Enzyme tests.
- Google Autocomplete API.
- CSS Modules.
